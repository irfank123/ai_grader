# **AI-Powered Pre-Calculus Certification System**

## **Overview**

This project is an **AI-driven certification system** focused on **Pre-Calculus**. It allows students to take exams, submit their answers (both written and spoken), and receive instant feedback and grading from an AI system. The goal is to create a rigorous, scalable system that can handle various types of questions, evaluate answers automatically, and provide personalized feedback.

### **Features**
- Stores **Pre-Calculus questions**.
- Allows students to submit **written answers** and **spoken explanations**.
- Uses **speech-to-text conversion** to evaluate verbal answers.
- AI assigns scores and provides feedback on both written and verbal responses.
- Prevents cheating using **screen recording** and **LockDown Browser** (planned feature).
  
## **Project Structure**

The project consists of the following components:

1. **MongoDB Database**: Stores questions, user responses, and associated metadata.
2. **Backend API (Flask)**: Handles the logic for retrieving questions, submitting answers, and evaluating responses.
3. **Frontend (React)**: Provides an interactive interface where students can take exams and submit their responses.

## **Database Design**

We are using **MongoDB** to store the Pre-Calculus questions and user responses. The database schema consists of four main collections: `Questions`, `Topics`, `Tags`, and `Responses`.

### **Database Collections**

1. **Questions Collection**
   - Stores all Pre-Calculus questions along with their associated metadata.
   
   **Schema Example**:
   ```json
   {
     "_id": "ObjectId",
     "question_text": "Simplify the expression (2x^2 + 3x - 5) - (x^2 - x + 4)",
     "topic_id": "ObjectId",  // Reference to Topic collection
     "difficulty": "Medium",
     "question_type": "Long Answer",
     "correct_answer": "x^2 + 4x - 9",
     "tags": ["ObjectId1", "ObjectId2"],  // Reference to Tag collection
     "created_at": "Timestamp",
     "updated_at": "Timestamp"
   }
   ```

2. **Topics Collection**
   - Defines various Pre-Calculus topics, such as Algebra and Trigonometry.
   
   **Schema Example**:
   ```json
   {
     "_id": "ObjectId",
     "topic_name": "Algebraic Expressions",
     "description": "Questions related to simplifying algebraic expressions"
   }
   ```

3. **Tags Collection**
   - Contains tags used for categorizing questions by difficulty, topic, or other attributes.
   
   **Schema Example**:
   ```json
   {
     "_id": "ObjectId",
     "tag_name": "Medium",
     "tag_type": "Difficulty"
   }
   ```

4. **Responses Collection**
   - Stores user responses to questions, including written answers, speech-to-text transcriptions, and AI evaluations.
   
   **Schema Example**:
   ```json
   {
     "_id": "ObjectId",
     "user_id": "ObjectId",  // Reference to User collection
     "question_id": "ObjectId",  // Reference to Question collection
     "submitted_answer": "x^2 + 4x - 9",
     "speech_to_text": "I simplified both sides of the equation and combined like terms",
     "score": 8,
     "feedback": "Good understanding of algebraic simplification",
     "created_at": "Timestamp",
     "updated_at": "Timestamp"
   }
   ```

## **API Endpoints**

The backend API, built using **Flask**, serves requests from the frontend. It handles the following functionality:

1. **GET /questions**: Fetch a list of Pre-Calculus questions.
2. **POST /responses**: Submit user responses to a specific question.
3. **GET /responses/{user_id}**: Fetch all responses for a specific user, including feedback and scores.

---

## **Tech Stack**

### **Backend**
- **Flask (Python)**: Backend API handling question retrieval, response submission, and AI evaluation.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing questions, topics, tags, and responses.
- **Pandas**: For managing and processing the dataset of Pre-Calculus questions.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: For AI-driven evaluation of both written and spoken responses.

### **Frontend**
- **React**: For building a dynamic user interface.
- **Canvas API**: For simulating a whiteboard-like interface where users can write their answers.

### **AI and Speech Recognition**
- **Google Speech-to-Text API**: For converting verbal explanations into text for evaluation.
- **GPT-4**: For evaluating user responses (both written and spoken) and providing feedback.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository
```

### **2. Backend Setup**

- Install required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- Start the Flask backend:
  ```bash
  flask run
  ```

### **3. Frontend Setup**

- Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  ```

- Start the React frontend:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

### **4. MongoDB Setup**

- Set up a MongoDB database, either locally or through a cloud service like **MongoDB Atlas**.
- Create the necessary collections: `Questions`, `Topics`, `Tags`, and `Responses`.
- Insert sample data into the collections.

### **5. Sample Data**

Here is a sample script to populate the **Questions** collection with Pre-Calculus questions:

```python
import pymongo
from datetime import datetime

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["precalculus_db"]

questions = db["questions"]

questions.insert_many([
    {
        "question_text": "Simplify the expression (2x^2 + 3x - 5) - (x^2 - x + 4)",
        "topic_id": "ObjectId('6513f8b8b7b5c21c249f07d1')",  # Algebraic Expressions
        "difficulty": "Medium",
        "question_type": "Long Answer",
        "correct_answer": "x^2 + 4x - 9",
        "tags": ["ObjectId('6513f8b8b7b5c21c249f07d3')", "ObjectId('6513f8b8b7b5c21c249f07d4')"],
        "created_at": datetime.now(),
        "updated_at": datetime.now()
    }
])
```

### **6. Environment Variables**

Set up environment variables for connecting to your MongoDB instance and any API keys you might need (such as the Google Speech-to-Text API).

## **Future Enhancements**

- **LockDown Browser Integration**: Add secure proctoring by preventing students from accessing other resources during exams.
- **Live AI Proctoring**: Add live AI-based proctoring to detect suspicious behavior and ask follow-up questions in real-time.
- **Support for Additional Subjects**: Expand beyond Pre-Calculus to other mathematics subjects and topics.
