# **Ethics Guidelines for AI-Powered Pre-Calculus Certification System**

## **Purpose of Data Collection** üìä

The **AI-Powered Pre-Calculus Certification System** collects data solely for **educational** and **research** purposes. This data is used to:
- Provide personalized feedback to students who submit Pre-Calculus answers.
- Enhance the AI grading model by improving its accuracy and response capabilities.
- Ensure the system can handle different types of questions, answers, and explanations (both written and spoken).

Our primary source for this project‚Äôs dataset is **DeepMind‚Äôs Math Dataset**, which provides high-quality mathematical problems and solutions. This data allows us to train and fine-tune our AI models for educational purposes.

## **Data Source: DeepMind‚Äôs Math Dataset** üìÇ

We are using **DeepMind‚Äôs Math Dataset** as the foundation for the questions and problems presented in the system. The dataset is publicly available and designed for academic and research purposes.

### **Ethical Use of DeepMind‚Äôs Dataset**:
- **Acknowledgment**: We respect and acknowledge DeepMind‚Äôs contributions in providing this dataset, which is crucial to building the system.
- **License Compliance**: We ensure compliance with any licenses or terms of use associated with the DeepMind dataset. The data will be used strictly in accordance with its intended academic and research purposes.
- **No Alteration of Original Data**: The dataset will not be altered or misrepresented in any way to ensure accuracy and preserve the integrity of the data.

## **Data Sources and Robots.txt** ü§ñ

We respect the terms of all websites and online resources from which we collect data. In addition to DeepMind's dataset, if other data sources are used, our data scraping practices include:
- **Only scraping sites that do not prohibit it** in their terms of service or `robots.txt` file.
- Ensuring that **robots.txt** is respected for each site we access, preventing unwanted or unethical scraping behavior.

Before collecting data from any website, we confirm that our actions comply with the website‚Äôs rules as indicated in their `robots.txt` file (e.g., `url.com/robots.txt`).

## **Collection Practices** üì¶

In our data collection process, we adhere to ethical standards by following these practices:
- **Limiting scraping**: We minimize scraping rates and operations to avoid causing disruptions or overwhelming servers.
- **Respecting privacy**: We **do not** bypass password protection, paywalls, or any other access controls that websites put in place to protect their content.
- **Data accuracy**: All collected data, including from DeepMind‚Äôs dataset, is verified for accuracy and relevance to Pre-Calculus topics.

---

## **Data Handling and Privacy** üîê

We take data privacy very seriously and handle all data with care. Our practices include:
- **No collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: We do not collect sensitive information such as user names, emails, or any other personal data.
- **Secure data storage**: If data needs to be stored temporarily, we ensure it is done securely and **protected from unauthorized access**.
  - For sensitive or large datasets, we include them in `.gitignore` to avoid them being stored in the project repository.
  - Data from **DeepMind‚Äôs Math Dataset** is stored in secure databases (e.g., MongoDB), and proper access controls are implemented.

---

## **Data Usage** üìö

All data collected through this project is used for:
- **Educational and research purposes only**.
- Improving the system's AI-based evaluation capabilities and providing a better learning experience for students.

We will not use any collected data for commercial purposes, advertising, or sharing with third parties without explicit consent.

---

## **Compliance with Guidelines** ‚úÖ

We strictly adhere to the following ethical guidelines:
- **Academic and research integrity**: All work is conducted in accordance with academic and research ethical standards.
- **Transparency**: Our practices are fully documented, and we are transparent about the sources and methods used for data collection.
